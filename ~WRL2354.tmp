# Project-2-ETL
INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus is a disease that affects the respiratory system at large; due to its impact on the world, every nation is fighting the pandemic in all available ways that it can. The scope of this project is to access data on how these developed countries, the USA, Canada, Italy and the UK, embraced the concept of the covid-19 vaccine. Particular interest is how fast and early these vaccines were delivered.
This is achieved by applying the ETL data modelling concept:
Extract
Transform
Load
Data Extraction
As a result of this work, We access four different sets of data from kaggle.com on vaccinations from the USA, Canada, Italy and Canada.

A resource folder was created from which the data is uploaded into a Pandas DataFrame

Conclusion
Working on the ETL modelling was a wonderful experience as it brought to light the importance of working in teams. The project took us through the various phases of project development.
The first step involved extracting information from kaggle.com, that is, a csv file. The data was then transformed into a schematic data by way of a cleansing operation where incomplete records were removed from the database. Finally, the schematic data was uploaded into an SQL database.
The data stored in the (SQL) data warehouse could be further investigated by looking at the population figures of each country to assess how well they dealt with the vaccination program. Figure below is an example of the vaccinations carried out over a period of six(6) months.
